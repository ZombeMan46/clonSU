# Šolska učilnica clon
This is a school project in Ruby on rails. I was trying to replicate our online class courses.

Activeadmin(What would teacher see):

On this website we can:
- Create an account, login with existing account
- Change our email and password,
- Request "forgoten password" that sends us recovery email,
- Upload files (not working atm.),
- Professor sign in.

To do:
- Make modules so teachers can assign work and add students
- Better style
- Teacher invites to courses

All the gems are present inside the GemFile, and all you need to do is run bundle install.
